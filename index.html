                            The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building
                            in Akihabara, where he
                            indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab
                            members: Mayuri Shiina, his
                            air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The
                            three pass the time by
                            tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave,"
                            which performs the strange
                            function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's
                            search for a scientific
                            breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of
                            mysterious happenings before
                            stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send emails to the past,
                            altering the flow of history.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes
                            Okabe through the depths of
                            scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present,
                            Okabe must shoulder the
                            burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.
